**************************ABSTRACTION ---> Implementation hiding.************************************

Interface: 
	1. Methods are 100% abstract --> means there is NO method body, no business logic. It can only
		declare method/s, but not implement. 
	2. Method/s CANNOT use the access modifier "protected" 
	
Abstract Class:
	1. Its know as partial abstract 0-100% ---> means it can have both types concrete & abstract 
		methods.
	
Regular Class:
	1. It can extend ONLY one Abstract Class.
	2. It can implement multiple Interfaces, with (,) separation.  
	3. Must implement the unimplemented methods in Interface & Abstract class if any. 
	4. It can have its own variables and methods. 
		-Methods --> must be complete with implementation.
